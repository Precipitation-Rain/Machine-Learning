I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.\\n\\nMy oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.\\n\\nThe phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.\\n\\nWhen we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.\\n\\nThe seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.\\n\\nLife got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.\\n\\nI went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.\\n\\nWhen I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).\\n\\nWhen I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!\\n\\nI also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!\\n\\nBetween the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!\", 'review_star_rating': '5', 'review_link': 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IP3AW6JCCIH6', 'review_author_id': 'AGV4EJPKXIBH34HA77QD7KJF4SCQ', 'review_author': 'Chely', 'review_author_url': 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGV4EJPKXIBH34HA77QD7KJF4SCQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8', 'review_author_avatar': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png', 'review_images': [], 'review_video': None, 'review_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2024', 'is_verified_purchase': True, 'helpful_vote_statement': '122 people found this helpful', 'reviewed_product_asin': 'B07ZPKN6YR', 'is_vine': False}, {'review_id': 'R1TFJYCE0QT5H2', 'review_title': 'In summary: useful, reliable, and unbeatable quality.

It’s been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.\\n\\n[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]\\n\\nMy issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.\\n1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we’d be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.\\n\\n2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend’s house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website.

I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.\\n\\nThe seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.\\n\\nLife got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.\\n\\nI went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.\\n\\nWhen I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).\\n\\nWhen I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!\\n\\nI also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!\\n\\nBetween the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!\",\n",

       "  'review_comment': 'The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It’s been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.\\n\\n[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]\\n\\nMy issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.\\n1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we’d be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.\\n\\n2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend’s house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.',\n",

Sooo, a used 11 seemed a logical choice, since her needs are minimal.  I have one as well and love it (no plans to upgrade).\\n\\nAfter hunting around for about a week, I finally committed.  The phone arrived early and properly packaged.  There were some scratches on the edges, but only one of note.  It even had a (perfect) screen protector.  It was unlocked, easy to set up, and seems to run flawlessly.  The battery reserve so far is okay, although iPhone Settings claim it is an aftermarket replacement, and cannot tell me anything about battery health.  Battery issues ae commonly reported with used phones, but mine seems fine.\\n\\nA couple of minor issues.  While the edge scratches were not functional, they were borderline for condition rated as \"excellent.\"  Also, when ordering, play the extra $5 for FedEx or UPS delivery.  Ours came USPS and arrived unexpected early.  It was left on the top of our mailbox, but I was able to get it before heading off for a short trip.\\n\\nTo sum up, this was a good phone at a decent price (about$225 with 128 GB memory).  When my phone needs replacement, I would go with this seller again, but would not buy anything rated less than \"excellent condition\".',\n",

My only concern was the battery life, it came at 76%. Its been almost two weeks since my purchase, no complaints except that. I switched my sim card over from my other phone too, no problems or concerns there, it shows up as unlocked. I love the Iphone 11 and it was a deal to get an extra 128gb of storage too. I just hate that I’ll have to get the battery replaced, didn’t plan on investing in this phone so soon. Because when I charge it when it gets to a low percentage, it kind of fluctuates before the percentage starts to go up and thats a little annoying. As you can see tho, it can get to full charge no issue except that. So overall, I’m happy with my purchase, its more than I expected at least.',\n",
